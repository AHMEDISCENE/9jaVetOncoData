1) Fix the Cases page Select (the one crashing)

This is almost always the sort Select or a filter Select. Your stacktrace points into src/components/ui/select.tsx only because that file re-exports the Radix parts—the real bug is in the page using it (likely src/pages/cases.tsx or a CasesToolbar component).

What to change (patterns)

Search the repo for these patterns and replace them as shown:

value="" → never. Use a real token or undefined.

Replace with: value="__all" (if it means “All”) or remove the value until chosen.

<Select defaultValue=""> → remove the empty default or set a real default (e.g., defaultValue="createdAt_desc").

const [value, setValue] = useState<string>("")
→ const [value, setValue] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined)

<Select value={state || ""} …>
→ <Select value={state ?? undefined} …>

<SelectItem value="">All</SelectItem>
→ <SelectItem value="__all">All</SelectItem>

If it’s the sort control, set a safe default

Use concrete tokens (no blanks):

createdAt_desc (Newest first)

createdAt_asc (Oldest first)

patient_asc (Patient A–Z)

diagnosisDate_desc (Latest diagnosis)

Example (minimal shape you’re aiming for—not a full refactor):

<Select value={sort ?? "createdAt_desc"} onValueChange={setSort}>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-[220px]">
    <SelectValue placeholder="Sort by" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    <SelectItem value="createdAt_desc">Newest first</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="createdAt_asc">Oldest first</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="patient_asc">Patient A–Z</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="diagnosisDate_desc">Diagnosis date (newest)</SelectItem>
  </SelectContent>
</Select>


Key points:

Every <SelectItem> has a non-empty value.

The Select’s value is never ""; use a real token or undefined.

Keep <SelectValue placeholder="Sort by" /> for the hint.

2) Fix Bulk Upload selects (same rule)

You showed this earlier in the importer. Apply the same changes to every Select in the import flow (file type, sheet picker, delimiter, and mapping selects):

For file type: values like "csv", "xlsx", "json", "zip", "auto". No blanks.

For mapping (column → field):

Canonical field values should be your keys (e.g., patient_name, species, breed, …).

Use "__skip" for “Skip this column” (not empty string).

For header-derived items (dynamic):

Filter out blank header names: .filter(h => h && h.trim() !== "")

If you must keep an unnamed header, generate a token value like "__unnamed_header_1" but display a friendly label “(Unnamed column 1)”.

Common offenders to search and fix globally:

<SelectItem value="">

value={""}

defaultValue=""

3) Prevent future regressions (tiny guard)

If you have a small wrapper around shadcn’s Select, add a one-line dev warning so an empty value can’t slip in again:

// before rendering <SelectItem ...>
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production" && (value as any) === "") {
  console.warn("<SelectItem> received empty string value; use a real token or undefined.");
}


This won’t “fix” at runtime (Radix still throws) but it points you at the culprit during development.

4) Re-run a quick check

Save the changes.

Stop/Run the repl.

Open the app in the external tab.

Go to Cases → the overlay should be gone and the page should render.

Go to Bulk Upload → no overlay; selects show placeholders until you pick.

If you still see the red overlay, run a global search for the string:

SelectItem value=""

value={""}
…and fix any remaining matches.

5) If “Unable to load cases (500)” still appears

That is a separate server-side issue (query or missing clinicId). Quick triage:

Create one new case successfully first (with Species, Breed, Tumour/Site, etc.).

If the Cases list still 500s, the API likely references a field that doesn’t exist (e.g., state if you haven’t added it), or clinicId is null.

Fast fix: in the list API, only select fields that exist in your Prisma schema, and ensure you’re filtering by a non-null clinicId (attach user to a default clinic if needed).

6) Minimal “tell Replit AI” message (paste this one-liner)

If you want the agent to do it for you, paste:

Search the repo for all Radix/shadcn Select misuses and fix: no <SelectItem value="">, no controlled value="", and no defaultValue="". Use real tokens like "createdAt_desc", "__all", "__skip", or undefined with a placeholder. Apply this to the Cases page (sort/filter) and Bulk Upload selects. Then restart and confirm both pages render without the red overlay.
