2) Bulk upload — column dictionary & synonyms (so mapping “just works”)

Use this to power the auto-mapping step and the “synonyms” tooltip. Keep keys lowercase.

Canonical columns
patient_name, species, breed, sex, age_years, state, clinic_name,
diagnosis_date, tumour_type, anatomical_site, laterality, stage,
diagnosis_method, treatment_plan, treatment_start, outcome, last_follow_up, notes

Common synonyms

breed: brd, type, mix

sex: gender, m/f, male/female

Value normalisation examples

Species: canine→Dog, feline→Cat.

Tumour abbreviations: MGT→Mammary Gland Tumour; TVT→Transmissible Venereal Tumour; SCC→Squamous Cell Carcinoma; STS→Soft Tissue Sarcoma.

Sex: m→M, f→F, other→Unknown.

Dates: accept YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY.

Dedupe rule (default)
If (clinic_name or clinicId) + patient_name + diagnosis_date + tumour_type match an existing case → treat as duplicate (show merge/skip choice).

3) Form microcopy (labels, helper text, placeholders, short errors)
Step 1 — Patient & Signalment

Patient Name
Helper: “Use a name or unique ID.”
Placeholder: “e.g., Bingo”
Error: “Enter the patient name.”

Species
Options: Dog, Cat (only).
Error: “Select species.”

Step 2 — Tumour Details

Tumour Type
Helper: “Choose from list or Add custom.”
Placeholder: “Search tumour type…”
Error: “Select a type or add a custom name.”
Behavior rule: If you type a value, save it to tumourTypeCustom and do not send tumourTypeId.

Anatomical Site
Helper: “Choose from list or Add custom.”
Placeholder: “Search site…”
Error: “Select a site or add a custom name.”
Behavior rule: If you type a value, save it to anatomicalSiteCustom and do not send anatomicalSiteId.

Helper: “If known; free text accepted.”

Step 3 — Diagnosis & Treatment

Diagnosis Method
Options: Histopathology, Cytology/FNA, Imaging, Clinical.

Error (size): “File too large. Please upload files under 10 MB.”

Review
Helper: “Confirm details before submit. You can edit later.”

Global error style

Show simple, human text: “Can’t save case — Tumour Type is required or custom value missing.”

Hide raw JSON. Provide a “Copy technical details” link only in advanced view.

4) Notifications copy (seed and use going forward)

Case created: “New case {patient_name} saved in {clinic}.”

Import completed: “Bulk import finished — {inserted} added, {skipped} skipped, {errors} errors.”

Report ready: “Report {template} for {period} is ready to download.”

Follow-up due: “Follow-up due for {patient_name} on {date}.”

Unread counter shows the number of new events since the bell was last opened.

5) How to use this pack (no heavy code)

Create one file (e.g., /lib/constants.ts or /data/reference.json) containing the lists above in whatever structure your app prefers.

Seed script reads States and Clinics and inserts them if missing.

Form components read:

Species (Dog/Cat only)

Breeds filtered by species + always show Other (type)

Tumour & Site lists + “Add custom” path (write to …Custom fields)

States + Clinics picker

Bulk upload uses the column dictionary + synonyms to auto-map headers and normalise values.

Analytics adds filters for State and Clinic using these references.

If you want, I can turn this into two tiny files you can paste directly (a .ts constants file and a lean seed.ts snippet that only inserts what’s missing).
